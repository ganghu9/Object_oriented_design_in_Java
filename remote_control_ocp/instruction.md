Based on the code provided, it appears that the assignment is to practice the Open-Closed Principle (OCP) in the context of designing a remote control system. Here is a possible set of instructions for such an assignment:

1. **Review the current codebase: You have several classes that represent devices (TV, Projector, SurroundSoundSystem), a RemoteControl class that can interact with these devices, and a Person class that uses the remote control.**

2. **Identify an enhancement to the system: For instance, you might want to add a new type of device (like a DVDPlayer or GameConsole), or add a new functionality (like adjusting volume or changing channels).**

3. **Implement the enhancement in a way that adheres to the Open-Closed Principle. This might involve creating a new class for the new device, or extending the Device interface to include new methods. The key is to add the new functionality without modifying the existing classes.**

4. **Test your implementation: Write code that creates objects of your new class and interacts with them using the existing RemoteControl and Person classes. Ensure that your new code works as expected and that the existing functionality is still intact.**

The goal of the assignment is to understand how to design your code so that it is easy to extend with new functionality, without requiring changes to existing code. This is an important aspect of good software design, and is a key idea behind the Open-Closed Principle.
